The Hospitality Domain Analytics project, spanning from December 23 to February 2024, focuses on leveraging machine learning to enhance business outcomes in the hospitality industry. One of the key achievements in this project is the development and deployment of a machine learning model that accurately forecasts customer satisfaction and booking trends. This model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 96%, providing valuable insights into customer behavior and helping to optimize operational strategies.

A critical aspect of the project involved ensuring the integrity of the data used for analysis. Addressing challenges such as missing data and encoding categorical variables helped improve data quality by 33%. This improvement ensured that the data feeding the machine learning model was more reliable, which directly contributed to the model's high accuracy.

To determine the most effective approach for predicting customer satisfaction and booking trends, experiments were conducted using both classification and regression algorithms. This exploration allowed for the identification of the most suitable algorithms for this specific use case, optimizing the overall model performance.

Additionally, the project involved in-depth analysis of the factors influencing guest satisfaction and operational performance. By analyzing various data points, key factors were identified, allowing for a deeper understanding of the elements that contribute to a positive guest experience and efficient operations. This analysis is instrumental in guiding future business decisions within the hospitality sector.
